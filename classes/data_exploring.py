# Now I want to see how well the given sentiments are distributed across
# the train dataset. One way to accomplish this task is by understanding
# the common words by plotting wordclouds.
# A wordcloud is a visualization wherein the most frequent words appear
# in large size and the less frequent words appear in smaller sizes.
# Letâ€™s visualize all the words our data using the wordcloud plot.
